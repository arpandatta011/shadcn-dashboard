# 📊 Responsive Dashboard UI – Shadcn Template Based

This project is a **responsive, modern Dashboard UI** built with [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks), Tailwind CSS, and React. It replicates the *data and functionality* (not layout) of a provided reference image using **Shadcn blocks**, following best practices for layout, routing, and component reuse.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sidebar Navigation** (based on `sidebar-07` block)
- **Dashboard Table** (based on `dashboard-01` block)
- **Responsive Design** – works on all screen sizes
- **Dummy Data** – used to simulate real-world dashboard
- **React Router DOM** – handles page-based routing
- **Loading State** – minimal spinner for UX polish
- **Skeleton Loaders** – smooth experience while loading data
- **Clean Project Structure** – reusable components, clear folder setup

## 🧱 Shadcn/UI Blocks Used

We smartly extracted and composed parts from official Shadcn blocks:

- `sidebar-07`  
- `dashboard-01`  
- Skeleton, Table, and Card primitives from Shadcn blocks

## 🎨 Design Considerations
- **⚙️ Pixel-perfect margins & padding with Tailwind CSS**

- **💡 Responsive grid and flex layouts**

- **♻️Reusable Card, Table, Skeleton, Button components**

- **🔄Minimal loading state for async simulation**

- **🔐Accessible by default (Radix UI + Shadcn standards)**
